    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <h4>WeatherPY</h4>
    <p>
    The weather information for a randomized number of cities across the world is analyzed in search for the temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed variance throughout the
    planet's latitudes. After the direct comparison, the cities are divided into two groups; northern and southern hemispheres. This helps analyze how the target variables change form north to south.
    </p>
    <h4>VacationsPY</h4>
    <p>
        The previous information is narrowed down to personally specified parameters to search for the best cities to visit for vacations. Then a hotel location was searched using Google Places API.
        This hotels had to be withing 5000m from the city's coordenates, and pins were placed on top of the heatmap.
